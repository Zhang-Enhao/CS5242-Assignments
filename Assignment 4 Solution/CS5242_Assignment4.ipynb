    "### Task 2: Beam Search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Beam search is a more complex method that considers multiple candidate words rather than just a single word. At each time step, it keeps track of the top $ k $ most likely partial sequences (known as the beam width), and then expands these partial sequences based on their scores. Finally, it selects the sequence with the highest score from these expanded sequences. Beam search can provide more diverse results but might still result in repetitive outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic algorithm for beam search:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Start with an initial input sequence (usually a special token indicating the beginning of a sequence).\n",
    "   - Initialize a set of beams, each containing the initial sequence and its probability score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expansion**:\n",
    "   - For each beam, generate the next token in the sequence using the GPT model.\n",
    "   - Calculate the conditional probability of each possible next token given the current partial sequence.\n",
    "   - Expand each beam by appending each possible next token to the partial sequence, along with its updated probability score.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selection**:\n",
    "   - Select the top-k beams with the highest probability scores, where k is the beam width.\n",
    "   - Discard the remaining beams.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - If the generated token is an end-of-sequence token or a maximum sequence length is reached, terminate those beams.\n",
    "   - Repeat steps 2-4 until all remaining beams either terminate or reach the maximum sequence length.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beam search algorithm can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $ S_t^b $ denote the partial sequence for beam $ b $ at time step $ t $.\n",
    "- Let $ P(S_t^b) $ denote the probability of the partial sequence $ S_t^b $ up to time step $ t $.\n",
    "- Let $ P(w_t | S_t^b) $ denote the conditional probability of the next token $ w_t $ given the partial sequence $ S_t^b $ at time step $ t $.\n",
    "- Let $ K $ denote the beam width.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beam search algorithm can be summarized with the following formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   $ S_1^1 = \\text{[BOS]} $\n",
    "   $ P(S_1^1) = 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expansion**:\n",
    "   $ P(w_t | S_t^b) = \\text{GPT\\_Model}(S_t^b, w_t) $\n",
    "   $ S_{t+1}^b = S_t^b \\cup \\{w_t\\} $\n",
    "   $ P(S_{t+1}^b) = P(S_t^b) \\times P(w_t | S_t^b) $\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selection**:\n",
    "   $ (S_{t+1}^{(1)}, ..., S_{t+1}^{(K)}) = \\text{Top-K}(S_{t+1}^1, ..., S_{t+1}^B, K) $\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Termination**:\n",
    "   - Terminate beams that reach the maximum length or encounter an end-of-sequence token.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until all terminated or maximum-length beams are obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, beam search efficiently explores the space of possible sequences and provides a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, helping to find high-quality sequences in sequence generation tasks such as text generation with models like GPT."
